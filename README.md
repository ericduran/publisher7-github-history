# For Publisher 7 Team only.

Note: We refactored a lot of code and git doesn't track history after a git mv command.

In the terminal this is simple to fix, git log --follow files/path/for/history.js

Sadly the history button on github is now useless before the GREAT MOVE.

This chrome extension adds an extra "Publisher History" btn that rewrites the urls
to the history log before the "GREAT MOVE". Now you have your history back.
